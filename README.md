## Making Updates

1. Open the [`app/config.json`](https://github.com/christinahsperrier/christinahsperrier.github.io/blob/main/app/config.json) file and open the editor by clicking the edit button on the right.

2. Make the updates following the [JSON syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON).

3. Commit the changes and add a description for what changes were made.

## Adding Files

> Everything in the `public` folder will be available at `christinaperrier.com/file`. Add the story thumbnails and photography here following the folder format for the other files.

1. Open the [`public`](https://github.com/christinahsperrier/christinahsperrier.github.io/tree/main/public) folder.

2. Click the upload files button on the right.

3. Add the new files and commit changes with a message saying what was uploaded. If you need to put a bunch of files into their own folder upload a folder instead of just files.
